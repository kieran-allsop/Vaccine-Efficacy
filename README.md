# Vaccine-Efficacy

Vaccine-Efficacy is an R Markdown file that replicates all simulations in the paper [Awaiting the signal: Assessing the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines](INSERT PAPER LINK HERE).

## Overview

The markdown file makes it easy to reproduce all of the calculations in the paper [Awaiting the signal: Assessing the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines](INSERT PAPER LINK HERE). There are sections for false positive analysis, vaccine efficacy confidence intervals, simulating wait times for vaccine trials, statistical power analysis, and intermediate endpoints calculations. All simulations in the file are based off of [FDA guidelines](https://www.fda.gov/media/139638/download) for what is considered an effective vaccine. 

## How to use Vaccine-Efficacy

View the code in sim_fig_replication_0928.rmd to see how to use Vaccine-Efficacy. This markdown file contains all of the code and includes description for what is happening in each part. Running each section in order will produce the desired simulations. When knited, this markdown file will produce a HTML file.
